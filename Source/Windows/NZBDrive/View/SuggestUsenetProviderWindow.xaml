             You need access to a Usenet provider that supports binary newsgroups to access files on Usenet.<LineBreak/>
             In many cases it it a good idea to have a redundant setup with two or more Usenet providers and servers. In case a file-segment
             is missing on one server then NZBDrive will ask the other Usenet servers for the segment. Some Usenet providers have
             multiple servers. It is a very good idea to configure NZBDrive to use all possible servers.<LineBreak/>
             If you already have access to one or more Usenet servers, then you need to add the usenet server connections in NZBDrive first.
             If you do not have access to a Usenet provider then I can suggest one for you.
